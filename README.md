# The Rust Verification working group

This working group is intended to provide a forum for all things related to code generation for Rust.

## Why?

While `rustc` produces decent binary code, there are huge opportunities for improvement, be it performance-wise or code size-wise. This working group intends to find ways to make it better.

## Goals
* Find low-hanging fruits for easy gains, be it with more LLVM metadata, better data layouts or peephole optimisations.
* Improve LLVM itself for how it's used by the Rust compiler.
* Design new MIR-level optimisations.

## Get Involved

Join our IRC channel (`#wg-codegen` on moznet) or open an issue here to let us know about your idea du jour.

We follow the [Rust Code of Contact](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html). Any concerns should be brought to [rust-mods@rust-lang.org](mailto:rust-mods@rust-lang.org).
